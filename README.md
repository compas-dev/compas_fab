*Robotic fabrication package for the COMPAS Framework** that facilitates the
planning and execution of robotic fabrication processes. It provides interfaces
to existing software libraries and tools available in the field of robotics
(e.g. OMPL, ROS) and makes them accessible from within the parametric design
environment. The package builds upon [COMPAS](https://compas.dev/),
an open-source Python-based framework for collaboration and research in
architecture, engineering and digital fabrication.


## Main features

* Multiple backends for simulation and execution (eg. [ROS: Robot Operating System](https://ros.org))
* Planning tools: kinematic solvers, path planning, etc.
* Execution tools: feedback loops, robot control, etc.

**COMPAS FAB** runs on Python 3.x and IronPython 2.7.


## Getting Started

The recommended way to install **COMPAS FAB** is to use [anaconda/conda](https://conda.io/docs/):

    conda install -c conda-forge compas_fab

It can also be installed using `pip`:

    pip install compas_fab


> On Windows, you may need to install [Microsoft Visual C++ 14.0](https://www.scivision.co/python-windows-visual-c++-14-required/).


Once the installation is completed, you can verify your setup.
Start Python from the command prompt and run the following:

    >>> import compas_fab
