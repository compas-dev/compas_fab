Plan motion
*******************************************************************************

.. note::

    The following examples use the `ROS <http://www.ros.org/>`_ backend
    and the MoveI! planner for UR5 robots. Before running them, please
    make sure you have the :ref:`ROS backend <ros_backend>` correctly
    configured and the :ref:`UR5 Planner <ros_bundles_list>` started.

There are 2 function that allow to plan a robotic movement without collisions:
`plan_cartesian_motion` and `plan_motion`.

.. More coming soon ...

Plan cartesian motion
=====================

.. literalinclude :: files/scripts/04_plan_cartesian_motion.py
   :language: python

Plan single cartesian motion with Choreo
========================================

.. .. literalinclude :: files/scripts/04_plan_cartesian_motion.py
..    :language: python


Plan multiple cartesian motions with Choreo
===========================================

Plan motion
===========

In contrast to the cartesian path, the `plan_motion` allows to describe the
goal with constraints rather than defined frames.
