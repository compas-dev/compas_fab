Kinematic model
*******************************************************************************

A kinematic model describes the motion of a robot in mathematical form without
considering the forces that affect motion and concerns itself with the
geometric relationship between elements.

In the kinematic model of a robot, the connection of different manipulator
joints is known as **link**, and the integration of two or more links is called
a **joint**. This kinematic model can be represented as a tree structure. The
tree describes the kinematic chain, i.e., the connection of robotic links with
joints, and the inter-dependendencies of these links. This tree structure plus
the underlying geometric information can be defined in Unified Robot
Description Format (URDF), which describes any robot (see for example
`UR5 URDF`_). If the robot is mounted on external axes, these links and joints
can be added as well.

    An industrial robot's links and joints, and the according tree structure
    describing the kinematic model.

.. Actually it would be good to have here a robot on a linear axis...

In **COMPAS FAB**, the kinematic model is represented by the :class:`compas_robots.RobotModel` class,
which closely resembles the URDF structure. It is used as part of the
:class:`compas_fab.robots.RobotCell` class, which represents the entire robot cell.
The :ref:`robot cell library provides a collection of ready-made RobotCells<robot_cell_library>`
with different `RobotModels` for demonstration purposes, they can be used for
learning and testing purposes. When you are ready to work with your own robot,
you can :ref:`create your own RobotModel<custom_robot>` and
:ref:`compose your own RobotCell<robot_cell>`.

Links
=====

Robot links are solid mechanical elements. Depending on the kinematic model,
movement of certain input links allows the output links to move at various
motions.

Joints
======

The joints are the elements in a robot which helps the links to travel in
different kind of movements. The three major types of joints are:

* **Revolute**: A hinge joint that rotates along the axis and has a limited
  range specified by the upper and lower limits.
* **Prismatic**: A sliding joint that slides along the axis, and has a limited
  range specified by the upper and lower limits.
* **Fixed**: Not really a joint because it cannot move, all degrees of freedom
  are locked.

**COMPAS** Framework provides classes to describe robot models. The following
snippet shows how to describe a UR5 robot:

.. code-block:: python

    from compas_robots import RobotModel
    from compas_robots.model import Joint
    from compas_robots.model import Link

    robot = RobotModel('ur5',
                  joints=[
                      Joint('shoulder_pan_joint', 'revolute', parent='base_link', child='shoulder_link'),
                      Joint('shoulder_lift_joint', 'revolute', parent='shoulder_link', child='upper_arm_link'),
                      Joint('elbow_joint', 'revolute', parent='upper_arm_link', child='forearm_link'),
                      Joint('wrist_1_joint', 'revolute', parent='forearm_link', child='wrist_1_link'),
                      Joint('wrist_2_joint', 'revolute', parent='wrist_1_link', child='wrist_2_link'),
                      Joint('wrist_3_joint', 'revolute', parent='wrist_2_link', child='wrist_3_link'),
                  ], links=[
                      Link('base_link'),
                      Link('shoulder_link'),
                      Link('upper_arm_link'),
                      Link('forearm_link'),
                      Link('wrist_1_link'),
                      Link('wrist_2_link'),
                      Link('wrist_3_link'),
                  ])
    print(robot)
